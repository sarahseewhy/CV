##Sarah C Young

Developer always curious to see how and why things work. Historian by training, developer by choice, cheerful by nature.

I thrive in collaborative, team-based environments working with colleagues who share my curiosity for all things code, my enthusiasm for best practices, and my passion for community building.

Grounded in a fascination with what makes objects and organisations ‘tick’ I followed a career as a historian of culture and computer science. Seeking more collaborative work I shifted careers to pursue a field that intrigued and challenged me: software development.
