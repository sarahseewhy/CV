###Web Development
---------------
Grounded in a fascination with what makes objects and organisations ‘tick’ I pursued a career as a historian of culture and technology. Seeking more collaborative work I shifted careers to communications before choosing to delve into a field that intrigued and challenged me: software development. 

I joined Makers Academy to develop the skills and practices I would need on the journey of becoming a developer.
